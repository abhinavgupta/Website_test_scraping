<h1>Official Google Blog: A Google Health update</h1>


<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en-US/health/about/">Google Health</a> launched a bit over two years ago, and since then we&#8217;ve been listening to our users, analyzing feedback and <a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2010/09/focusing-on-our-users-google-health.html">conducting research</a>. We&#8217;ve learned a lot from you! You&#8217;ve confirmed that having a central place online to store and share medical data with whomever you want is important and a step in the right direction. And we&#8217;ve added a number of features based on what you&#8217;ve asked for so far. But you&#8217;ve also told us that it&#8217;s not enough; that you&#8217;re also looking for tools that will help you act on all your health and wellness concerns. We&#8217;ve heard you ask for easier data tracking, more personalization and the ability to set and track progress toward your health goals. We&#8217;ve listened, and today we&#8217;re announcing a new design and new features for Google Health.<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_7ZYqYi4xigk/TI_e0BNcEwI/AAAAAAAAG0E/aUQ1Eecdem4/s1600/Dashboard_Cutout_Final.png"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_7ZYqYi4xigk/TI_e0BNcEwI/AAAAAAAAG0E/aUQ1Eecdem4/Dashboard_Cutout_Final.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5516873053811512066" /></a><br />So what&#8217;s new?  Well, we&#8217;ve developed an easier-to-use dashboard that brings together even more of your health and wellness information in one place and makes it easier for you to organize and act on that information. We&#8217;ve also heard from you that focusing on wellness, and wellness goals, is a big part of the solution, and that it&#8217;s important to record your daily experience and set goals.</p><p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_7ZYqYi4xigk/TI_e0iV3pnI/AAAAAAAAG0M/fv0ZkInqwdo/s1600/WeightTrackerChart_Final.png"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_7ZYqYi4xigk/TI_e0iV3pnI/AAAAAAAAG0M/fv0ZkInqwdo/WeightTrackerChart_Final.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5516873062705243762" /></a><br />So our new re-design better organizes your medical information, while creating a more welcoming place to set goals for yourself and check in daily on your progress. For example, you might want to set a goal around walking more each day or to lower your cholesterol over time. With our new design, you can easily monitor your path to success with a visual graph that shows your progress towards your personalized goal. You can even create custom trackers for other things that you want to monitor like daily sleep, exercise, pregnancy or even how many cups of coffee you drink a day.</p><p>We&#8217;ve also integrated with several new partners to make it easier for you to collect the data you need to track your progress, including <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/">Fitbit</a>, maker of a wearable device that captures health and wellness data such as steps taken, calories burned and sleep quality; and <a href="http://www.worksmartlabs.com/cardiotrainer/about.php">CardioTrainer</a>, one of the top mobile apps for tracking fitness activity and weight loss. In the two weeks since CardioTrainer&#8217;s integration went live, CardioTrainer developer <a href="http://www.worksmartlabs.com/company.php">WorkSmart Labs</a> reports that users have already uploaded more than 150,000 workouts to Google Health, where they can more easily view, track and set goals around their workouts and monitor them along with other health and wellness information.</p><p>Besides tracking progress toward your health goals, our new design also gives you the ability to take notes or keep a journal on your progress for each health condition or medication you&#8217;re taking.  The new design also delivers information that is more personalized to your particular set of medical conditions or specific medications. You can access improved content links for each medical condition, medication or lab result you have in your Google Health profile. And we&#8217;ve made the Google Health profile easier to read and customize, with the ability to hide past items or sections that are outdated or no longer relevant.  All of this helps you keep your dashboard up-to-date with current, relevant information, while still letting you maintain a complete health history.</p><p>In addition to redesigning the product and forming new partnerships with device and mobile apps developers, we&#8217;ve continued to expand our more traditional integrations with hospitals and other healthcare data providers. Three recent highlights include <a href="http://www.lpch.org/">Lucile Packard Children&#8217;s Hospital at Stanford</a>, <a href="http://www.upmc.com/Pages/default.aspx">University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)</a> and <a href="http://www.sharp.com/index.cfm">Sharp HealthCare</a>.</p><p>With this update, we&#8217;ve made Google Health an even more powerful tool for organizing all your health information online, and also for achieving your health and wellness goals. We think you&#8217;ll find that organized, measurable and engaging information helps make it easier to achieve better health and wellness.</p><p><span>Posted by Aaron Brown, Senior Product Manager</span>
